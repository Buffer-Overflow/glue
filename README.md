### What is Glue?
Glue is a Canvas based JavaScript game engine. Glue is component based, has a lightweight footprint and is developed mobile-first.

### Some key features
- Performance: Glue is tested on all recent touch/mobile devices to be sure it delivers a performant gaming experience to your users no matter what device they are playing your game on.
- Dynamic scaling: Your game scales automatically to fit the device it's being played on. Landscape and portrait mode are also supported.
- Component based: Create components to control the behaviour of you game objects in a reusable way.
- Asset loader: Glue comes with an asset loader which displays a progress indicator and loading bar while the assets are being loaded.
- Drag & Drop: Glue supports Drag & Drop through the Draggable and Droptarget components, making it easy to create a rich user interface.
- Audio: Glue contains an audio library which uses the Webaudio API with a fallback to the audio tag.
- Event driven: Glue has built-in delegation of browser events to all game components and also contains system events to develop your games in an event driven way.
- Animation: The built-in Animatable component contains all you need to be able to create spritesheet animations.
- More features are in development and will be added soon...
